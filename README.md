# Lazymake
*Lazy man's makefile*

**Lazymake** is a directory structure and makefile designed to be **simplistic** without getting too deep into makefile syntax while still being **dynamic** and **scalable**.

## Background
As a programmer and fan of automation in general, the last thing I want is a static file that must be manually updated every time I add a new source file. I also don't want to have to spend hours or even *days* trying to understand strange makefile syntax or something as complicated and overbearing as CMake. 

Enter: lazymake. Now, I don't need to modify the makefile at all when I add a new source or header file. All I have to do is plop it in the correct directory and let the makefile do the rest.

## Installation & Usage
Lazymake isn't actually an application or library, it's literally just a makefile, nothing special. 

-Add source files to src/
-Add Header files to src/headers/
-Change references in the makefile from "app" or "App" to the name of your application
-Run "make" from the same directory as the makefile
-The built application binary/executable should now be found in the build/ directory
-???
-Profit
